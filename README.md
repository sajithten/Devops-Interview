What are the first 3 steps you would take to debug a high memory utilization problem on a Linux server?

# Scripting

Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file input.txt.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

input.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.

Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.

Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

Example:

Assume that input.txt has the following content:

the day is sunny the the the sunny is is
Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:

the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
Note:

Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.

Could you write it in one-line using Unix pipes?
